# DSA_in_Terminal

## Description

Visualize some of the most utilized data structures and their operations right in your terminal. Along with data structures, you can also visualize some commonly 
used algorithms such as insertion sort, binary search, also in your local system. This will help you better understand the concept and develop intuition, which is must
if you wanna become a good software developer.  

## Installation and Usage

Its not an application(yet) so you don't need to install it to get it working. Just pull the repo or download and its ready to use. Fire up your terminal and enjoy nice
visualiztions. If you like it, please show it on github too.
